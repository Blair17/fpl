# Amateur Fantasy Premier League (FPL) football analysis code
A collection of Python scripts that retrieve data from the FPL site using the FPL API. Data is then stored and analysed in a Pandas dataframe. The analysis includes both player and team statistics.

These scripts were tested using Python 3.11.
